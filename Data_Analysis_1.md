# Goal

## Experiments don’t have to be complicated. They can be so simple as comparing a pair of techniques
	-1 factor with 2 levels
## In cases like these, we don’t need expensive tools (SPSS, STATA, etc.) to analyze the experimental results
## We will learn how to test hypothesis using paper and pencil

# Outline

## Descriptive statistics
## Reference distributions
	— Null Hypothesis
## Standard distributions (for mean differences)
	— Parametric: t
	— Non-parametric: Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney
## Advanced concepts
	— 2-tailed tests
	— Statistical power
	— Determination of sample size

# A simple experiment

## A scholar wants to know if technique A (say functional testing) is better than B (say inspection)
## He performs an experiment with some students and gets the following data (metric doesn’t matter):

# Question

## How can we decide which technique (A, B) is better?
## The most obvious option is looking at the data:
### Descriptive statistics
	— Median, means
	— Quartiles, variances, standard deviation
### and suitable plots
	— Box plots

# Box plot

## Preliminary answer
	— B looks better, but the results are quite similar. We cannot be sure
	— It is likely that differences arise due to random chance
	— Don’t believe it? Try to toss a coin 4 times and guess the number of heads you obtain 
## As we can see from this example, many processes have an associated probability distribution
	##How can we make a decision on this case?
