# Empirical Software Engineering Course

This website contains slices correponding to an hypothetical Empirical Experimental Software Engineering course, either at 300-400 undergraduate level, or master level. It is by no means stable, and the idea is precisely that: foster collaboration so that 3rd parties (who, for us, are 1st ones) give away their knowledge and expetise to make something valuable: a shared experimental SE course.
